## Development

### Spec-Driven Development

This project follows a specification-driven approach. All features are documented in `.claude/spec/` before implementation:

- **Check `.claude/spec/_context.md`** for current project status
- Each spec defines requirements, implementation details, and acceptance criteria
- Specs are tracked through statuses: Planned → In Progress → Implemented → Tested

### Building for Production

```bash
# Windows (self-contained)
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained -p:PublishSingleFile=true

# macOS ARM (self-contained)
dotnet publish -c Release -r osx-arm64 --self-contained -p:PublishSingleFile=true
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run tests with coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

# Run specific test project
dotnet test tests/SDAHymns.Tests
```

### Database Migrations

```bash
# Add new migration
dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName --project src/SDAHymns.Core

# Update database
dotnet ef database update --project src/SDAHymns.Core

# Remove last migration
dotnet ef migrations remove --project src/SDAHymns.Core
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This project aims for industry-standard testing coverage and code quality.

### Development Workflow

1. Check `.claude/spec/_context.md` for current priorities
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Write tests first (TDD approach)
4. Implement the feature
5. Ensure all tests pass
6. Update relevant spec files
7. Submit a pull request

### Code Style

- Follow C# naming conventions
- Use nullable reference types
- Write XML documentation for public APIs
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
